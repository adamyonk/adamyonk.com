Tim Cook on Sir Jony Ive in a [Rock Center interview][link] with Brian Williams:

> Jony \[Ive, senior vice president of industrial design\], who I think has the best taste of anyone in the world and the best design skills, now has responsibility for the human interface. I mean, look at our products. (Cook reaches for his iPhone.) The face of this is the software, right? And the face of this iPad is the software. So it’s saying, Jony has done a remarkable job leading our hardware design, so let’s also have Jony responsible for the software and the look and feel of the software, not the underlying architecture and so forth, but the look and feel. I don’t think there’s anybody in the world that has a better taste than he does. So I think he’s very special. He’s an original.

What an incredible reputation to have.
