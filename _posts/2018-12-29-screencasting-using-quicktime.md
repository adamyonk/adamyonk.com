I've found a lot of value in demoing work as a person who works on a
distributed team. It helps to communicate outwards the things you're working on
and it encourages teams to celebrate accomplishments. Video demos are great
because you can explain in plain language the thing you're demonstrating, and
it gives some warmth to what could, in our field, be a
pretty technical and cold bunch of information.

There are surely more automatic options for this, but I wanted a way to record
a screencast with a small video of myself picture-in-picture-style without
having to buy or download any apps. It turns out, the macOS screenshot utility
and QuickTime make it somewhat easy.

First, open up QuickTime player and start a _New Movie Recording_.

Then, select _View > Float on Top_.

Hit ⇧⌘5 to open the screenshot utility and select whole screen or screen
selection. Be sure to open the _Options_ menu and ensure there is a microphone
selected.

Record!
