## Professional Summary

After 20+ years building the web, I've developed a genuine passion for JavaScript and front-end architecture. My journey has taken me from vanilla JS to modern frameworks and back again, giving me a comprehensive understanding of what makes excellent web applications. I've led teams through major technical transformations, created component libraries that developers actually enjoy using, worked across team and discipline boundaries, and mentored peers along the way. What drives me is crafting intuitive interfaces that solve real problems for users, while writing clean, maintainable code that stands the test of time.

### InVision

Senior Software Engineer, Lead Software Engineer  
June 2018 – November 2020

I worked closely with the design team and led the charge to implement an "App Store" UI for third-party InVision Studio plugins. I refactored legacy code in the InVision Studio Electron application to better separate logical and presentation code, and created a better interface for user input. I was made team lead for our "design system" project in which I architected and organized a component library package to speed up development and increase the testability of our UI layer. I was certified as an "incident commander" in InVision's certification program.

- New & existing feature development for [InVision Studio](https://www.invisionapp.com/studio) (Electron, Node.js, TypeScript, React, Redux)
- Development of the Studio App Store (TypeScript, React, GraphQL, Apollo)

### Librato/SolarWinds

Front End Engineer, Senior Engineer  
December 2013 – June 2018

I was fortunate enough to be hired to work with a bunch of data-visualization nerds at Librato (now [AppOptics](https://appoptics.com/)) when it was still in the startup stage. I did everything from API work, to front-end architecture, to developer tools there. I spent a lot of time tuning and maintaining large customer-facing applications, researching and selecting technologies for new projects, documenting developer best practices, and writing command-line tools for developer happiness.

- Front end development, build process, architecture (webpack, Babel, React, Apollo, Redux, Backbone, Angular)
- Ruby development (Rails, Sinatra)
- Developer tools (Bash, Node.js, Docker, Vagrant)

### Pure Charity

Developer  
July 2011 – November 2013

At Pure Charity, I was hired to help build their [online giving application](http://purecharity.com/) with a focus on front-end technologies. We had very open roles in the company and I took that opportunity to begin working more with Ruby and Rails and owning features from top to bottom. After a year, I was promoted to the lead front end programmer and architect; a typical day for me there was building features of all shapes and sizes, providing support to other developers on the team, and spending time reviewing code to ensure that it adhered to best practices. I also discovered a passion for writing statistical and analytics tools for our business team, and for finding ways to automate tedious processes for the whole company.

- All front-end development and architecture (Haml, Sass, CoffeeScript, AJAX, PJAX, JavaScript templating, Backbone)
- Rails development
- Ruby development and automation

### Elevate, LLC

Developer  
February 2005 – July 2011

I was hired as employee Nº 2 at [Elevate](http://elevate.co/), a web design and development startup, as an intern in high school. I organized copy and built the front ends for all of Elevate’s contract work. After graduating high school, I was promoted to lead developer and began working full-time. I worked very closely with the owner/designer and was challenged constantly to translate his designs into working interfaces that were functional and intuitive. Being a part of a very small company, I was stretched to learn about the business and develop the ability to teach myself and grow whatever skill was necessary to bring ideas and goals to fruition.

- All front-end development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Sass, CoffeeScript)
- Building and maintaining WordPress sites
- Building and maintaining PHP sites using a custom content management system
