# Name
adamjahnke v29.3 - Software Programmer

# Synopsis
I love to build things that help people. I love the idea of tackling something
complex one time so that others can **do** something complex later without the
burden of that complexity.

# Description
I've been writing software since 2006, and I love it. I especially enjoy
working on tooling and interfaces, the things that humans are regularly
interacting with. I've spent a lot of time collaborating closely with designers.

# Usage
Though I have worked remotely for nearly the entirety of my career, I really
love to work **with** people. I don't think distance needs to be a hindrance to
that. I do well developing trust with my colleagues and I value humility.

I see new people, environments, and challenges as opportunities to learn. I
sincerely value feedback, even if it's negative; I want to be better.

I don't shy away from difficult problems, and I am not afraid to be the team's
"fixer". I'll take the hard bugs.

# Caveats
I tend to want to make people happy, so sometimes I struggle to give
constructive negative feedback. I am working on trying to communicate more
clearly, even when I don't get to be the bearer of good news.

# Examples
I have experience with Ruby and JavaScript. I'm quite familiar with the
landscape of JavaScript tooling and architecture. I have dabbled in PHP, Lua,
and Go.

# Exit Status
0 on success, any other positive value otherwise.

# Bugs
I have been known to have bugs. I welcome feedback and honestly desire to improve!
