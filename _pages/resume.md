# Job History

## Jeli

Software Engineer  
November 2020 — Present

### Responsibilities:

- Iteratively migrated front end from create-react-app with home-grown deployment system to Next.js on Vercel
- Architectural decisionmaking
- Custom data visualizations
- Internal tooling

## InVision

Senior Software Engineer, Lead Software Engineer  
June 2018 – November 2020

I have worked closely with the design team and led the charge to implement an "App Store" UI for third-party Studio
plugins. I've been refactoring legacy code in the Studio Electron application to better separate logical and
presentation code, and create a better interface for user input. I was made team lead for our "design system" project in
which I architected and organized a component library package to speed up development and increase the testability of
our UI layer.

### Responsibilities:

- New & existing feature development for [InVision Studio](https://www.invisionapp.com/studio) (Node.js, TypeScript,
  React, Redux)
- Development of the Studio App Store (TypeScript, React, GraphQL, Apollo)
- Project lead, development of the Studio Design System (TypeScript, React, Storybook, Webpack, Tailwind, GitHub
  Actions)
- Refactoring the Studio design tools (camera tools, keyboard shortcuts, user input)

## Librato/SolarWinds

Front End Engineer, Senior Engineer  
December 2013 – June 2018

I was fortunate enough to be hired to work with a bunch of data-visualization nerds at Librato (now
[AppOptics](https://appoptics.com)) when it was still in the startup stage. I did everything from API work, to front-end
architecture, to developer tools there. I spent a lot of time tuning and maintaining large customer-facing applications,
researching and selecting technologies for new projects, documenting developer best practices, and writing command-line
tools for developer happiness.

### Responsibilities:

- Front end development, build process, architecture (webpack, Babel, React, Apollo, Redux, Backbone, Angular)
- Ruby development (Rails, Sinatra)
- Developer tools (Bash, Node.js, Docker, Vagrant)

## Pure Charity

Developer  
July 2011 – November 2013

At Pure Charity, I was hired to help build their [online giving application](http://purecharity.com) with a focus on
front-end technologies. We had very open roles in the company and I took that opportunity to begin working more with
Ruby and Rails and owning features from top to bottom. After a year, I was promoted to the lead front end programmer and
architect; a typical day for me there was building features of all shapes and sizes, providing support to other
developers on the team, and spending time reviewing code to ensure that it adhered to best practices. I also discovered
a passion for writing statistical and analytics tools for our business team, and for finding ways to automate tedious
processes for the whole company.

### Responsibilities:

- All front-end development and architecture (Haml, Sass, CoffeeScript, AJAX, PJAX, JavaScript templating, Backbone)
- Rails development
- Ruby development and automation

## Elevate, LLC

Developer  
February 2005 – July 2011

I was hired as employee Nº 2 at [Elevate](http://elevate.co), a web design and development startup, as an intern in high
school. I organized copy and built the front ends for all of Elevate’s contract work. After graduating high school, I
was promoted to lead developer and began working full-time. I worked very closely with the owner/designer and was
challenged constantly to translate his designs into working interfaces that were functional and intuitive. Being a part
of a very small company, I was stretched to learn about the business and develop the ability to teach myself and grow
whatever skill was necessary to bring ideas and goals to fruition.

### Responsibilities:

- All front-end development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Sass, CoffeeScript)
- Building and maintaining WordPress sites
- Building and maintaining PHP sites using a custom content management system
