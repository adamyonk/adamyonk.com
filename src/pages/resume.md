# Job History

## InVision

Senior Programmer, Lead Programmer  
June 2018 – Present

I have worked closely with the design team and led the charge to implement an
"App Store" UI for third-party Studio plugins. I've been refactoring legacy
code in the Studio Electron application to better separate logical and
presentation code, and create a better interface for user input. I was made
team lead for our "design system" project in which I architected and organized
a component library package to speed up development and increase the
testability of our UI layer.

### Responsibilities:

- New & existing feature development for [InVision
  Studio](https://www.invisionapp.com/studio) (Node.js, TypeScript, React,
  Redux)
- Development of the Studio App Store (TypeScript, React, GraphQL, Apollo)
- Project lead, development of the Studio Design System (TypeScript, React,
  Storybook, Webpack, Tailwind, GitHub Actions)
- Refactoring the Studio design tools (camera tools, keyboard shortcuts, user
  input)

## Librato/SolarWinds

Programmer, Senior Programmer  
December 2013 – June 2018

I was fortunate enough to be hired to work with a bunch of data-visualization
nerds at Librato (now [AppOptics](https://appoptics.com)) when it was still in
the startup stage. I did everything from API work, to front-end architecture,
to developer tools there. I spent a lot of time tuning and maintaining large
customer-facing applications, researching and selecting technologies for new
projects, documenting developer best practices, and writing command-line tools
for developer happiness.

### Responsibilities:

- Front end development, build process, architecture (webpack, Babel, React,
  Apollo, Redux, Backbone, Angular)
- Ruby development (Rails, Sinatra)
- Developer tools (Bash, Node.js, Docker, Vagrant)

## Pure Charity

Programmer, Lead Front End Programmer  
July 2011 – November 2013

At Pure Charity, I was hired to help build their
[online giving application](http://purecharity.com) with a focus on front-end
technologies. We had very open roles in the company and I took that opportunity
to begin working more with Ruby and Rails and owning features from top to
bottom. After a year, I was promoted to the lead front end programmer and
architect; a typical day for me there was building features of all shapes and
sizes, providing support to other developers on the team, and spending time
reviewing code to ensure that it adhered to best practices. I also discovered a
passion for writing statistical and analytics tools for our business team, and
for finding ways to automate tedious processes for the whole company.

### Responsibilities:

- All front-end development and architecture (Haml, Sass, CoffeeScript, AJAX,
  PJAX, JavaScript templating, Backbone)
- Rails development
- Ruby development and automation

## Elevate, LLC

Programmer  
February 2005 – July 2011

I was hired as employee Nº 2 at [Elevate](http://elevate.co), a web design
and development startup, as an intern in high school. I organized copy and
built the front ends for all of Elevate’s contract work. After graduating high
school, I was promoted to lead developer and began working full-time. I worked
very closely with the owner/designer and was challenged constantly to translate
his designs into working interfaces that were functional and intuitive. Being a
part of a very small company, I was stretched to learn about the business and
develop the ability to teach myself and grow whatever skill was necessary to
bring ideas and goals to fruition.

### Responsibilities:

- All front-end development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Sass, CoffeeScript)
- Building and maintaining WordPress sites
- Building and maintaining PHP sites using a custom content management system
